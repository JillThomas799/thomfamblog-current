            still an excellent, informative museum and site and there are some

            From there, we went on to join the Hadrian's Wall Path which, for
            the first 12 miles runs not along the original line of Hadrian's
            Wall but along the route 72 cycle and pedestrian way along the
            Northern bank of the River Tyne. This path is much pleasanter than
            might be imagined, despite it being through quite an urban area. It
            is also a cycle path, so you just need to keep a look out for
            cyclists to let them past. Our favourite section was when we dropped
            down to be right beside the River Tyne. The Ropery formed a good
            spot for a packed lunch as there was a bench to sit on.

            After lunch, it was a leisurely wander into Newcastle city centre
            via the Quayside. It was a beautifully sunny Saturday afternoon so
            people were making full use of the riverside and rooftop bars and
            restaurants. On arrival in Newcastle city centre, it was time for

              Due to the Red Bull Tyne Ride Event, a significant number of roads
              in the centre of Newcastle were closed, which added to the fact it
              was Saturday lunchtime, made the short journey between Tyne
              Riverside Country Park and the parking in the city centre quite
              slow and challenging.{" "}

              down than on Stage 1 of the walk and especially on the stretch
              along the Tyne riverside, a significant amount of history to learn
              about. This really gave a feel, not just of history relating to

            Today, we were heading back into Newcastle City Centre to undertake
          Stage 2 of the Hadrian's Wall Path, between Newcastle Gateshead
          millennium Bridge and Tyne Riverside Country Park. We were keen to
          finally get this segment completed as it had already had to be
          postponed on several occasions and the annual Great North Run Event is
          due to be on at the beginning of September, making access into the
          city, which is overwhelmingly busy, very restricted at that time.

          <div className="font-semibold text-md"> Fish Market : </div>
          There have been fish stalls on Sandhill going back to Medieval times.
          From 1823 the fish market was held in the new covered section of the
          Guildhall designed by John Dobson. In 1880 a new purpose-built indoor
          fish market was built on Sandhill. Later the fish market moved to
          Clayton Street and then eventually relocated as a dedicated section of
          the Green Market. Today, the old Fish Market, is now 'Riverside', a
          popular live music venue.

          <div className="font-semibold text-md"> Dunston Staiths : </div>
          Dunston Staiths, on the River Tyne, is believed to be the largest
          timber structure in Europe. It is a Scheduled Monument, Grade II
          listed and is owned by registered charity Tyne and Wear Building
          Preservation Trust (TWBPT). Opened in 1893 by the North East Railway
          Company, it was built to allow large quantities of coal arriving by
          rail from the Durham Coalfields to be loaded directly onto waiting
          colliers (coal ships) ready for the onward journey to customers in
          London and abroad. At the coal industry's peak around 5.5 million tons
          of coal was moved this way each year.

          </div>
          At its zenith, around the turn of the century, William Armstrong's
          Elswick and Scotswood works employed over 20,000 people. This
          workforce together with their families and the many small trades,
          industries, shops and the like which served them, accounted for the
          growth of most of the western suburbs of Newcastle. Scotswood and
          Elswick, along with four other small townships Jesmond, Heaton, Byker
          and Westgate – were taken into the boundaries of Newcastle Upon Tyne
          under the municipal Corporation Act of 1835. This expansion of the
          city brought the spread of housing into the suburbs. Fuelled by the
          growth of industry on the riverbank, the construction of houses in
          Elswick and Scotswood took place at a rapid and constant pace. In 1851
          the population of Elswick was 3,539.

          The glassworks site was leased from the Duke of Northumberland by a

          cones. This company owned the glassworks until 1837 when three of the
          glass houses were demolished, leaving the huge cone which is still in
          existence.

            Battle of Newburn Ford :{" "}
          </div>
          The Battle of Newburn Ford took place in Summer 1640 when a Scottish
          Covenanter army of 20,000 under Alexander Leslie defeated an English
          force of 5,000, led by Lord Conway. The only significant military
          action of the Second Bishop's War, victory enabled the Scots to take
          Newcastle, which provided the bulk of London's coal supplies, and
          allowed them to put pressure on the central government. It is
          important because it had far-reaching consequences for King Charles,
          setting the scene for a civil war in which King Charles lost his
          throne and his head and England became a republic for the first and
          last time under Oliver Cromwell. The main cause of the confrontation
          was religion, particularly as Archbishop William Laud has attempted to
          impose a new prayer book on the Scots.

          the A186. Built of unusually large stones, the turret has a platform
          in one corner, which probably served as the base for a ladder to reach
          the upper floors. Another 60-metre section of the Wall survives 300
          metres west, alongside the south verge of the A69.

            This climb up to Heddon-on-the-Wall is the very final stage of Day 1
            for East to West Hadrian's Wall Path walkers who are undertaking the
            trek over a week, and they complain about it a lot. We can see
            why....we would have not liked to climb up here after 16-18 miles
            walking. However, it was at the start of our walk, so all was well
            and good and we were soon in Heddon-on-the-Wall.

            It had been quite a long drive out to Tyne Riverside Country Park,
            so we felt it was time for coffees and refreshments. However, it was
            only 11.10am and so the{" "}

            there was a sign on the door; they were closed for their annual

            circumnavigated and headed onwards towards Harlow Hill, some 2.25
            miles away. There are some very muddy parts on this segment (see
            photos). But these soon sank into insignificance, when we came to{" "}
            <em>the great flood</em>, which was located just before Albermale

            Finally, we were back at Whittle dene Reservoirs and it was time for

            at East Wallhouses, which is also a stamping station for our
            Hadrian's Wall passports. The Inn apparently dates back to 1752 and
            is constructed with traditional stone, which is thought to have been
            sourced from Hadrian’s Wall. The Inn is often mentioned by Hadrian's
            Wall walkers and local people and in our opinion, having been there,
            with good reason. In spite of it being 10am in the morning and the
            owners in the middle of cleaning after breakfast, when we appeared
            through the door soaking wet, they were more than happy to get us
            seated, serve us some coffees and chat about their experience doing
            what we are doing ie. walking the Wall in stages at the weekend,
            last year. We understand that there is also the Vallum Farm Tearoom
            on the other side of the road as a possible place for refreshments,
            although we have not personally visited and it is important to
            distinguish this from the restaurant at that location.

            <br />
            Fully refreshed and dried out a little, and with our passports
            successfully stamped, we recommenced our journey. The path follows
            parallel to the B6318 but does cross this road a number of times, so
            it is necessary to take care. There are many stiles also along this
            section, which can become a little tiring after a while, but we
            would not advise being tempted to walk on the road, as some people
            were doing as the traffic travels very fast and your chances of
            surviving intact are questionable! The path anyway is well
            demarcated and signposted and whilst there is a reasonable ascent on
            all this stretch today, it is very gradual and therefore you do not
            really notice it. It is also a great stretch for visualising at
            length, and really getting a feel for the{" "}

            considered to be the finest section of the Hadrian's Wall Path
            (HWP). These 4 sections are also the best-preserved segments of the
            wall and it becomes obvious as you walk along the path of the wall
            why this should be, as the landscape becomes increasingly wild and

            First of all though, it was time to get our passports stamped at
            Chester's Fort. The only problem being it was not very clear which
            section of the passport was for which stamp, so we ended up
            mistakenly stamping Chester's in the Housesteads slot! Not to worry
            though, we are sure Northumberland National Parks are used to this
            and Elena said it was all part and parcel of the Hadrian's Wall
            experience!...

            <br />
            Key points and way-marks on the walk from Chollerford to
            Brocolitia/Carrawburgh Roman Fort include Chester's Roman Fort,
            Black Carts wall and Turret (29A), Limestone Corner, the trig point
            at 250 metres and Limestone corner.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Turret 29A (Black Carts):</strong> Black Carts is a 200 metre section of
            narrow wall. However, the accompanying Black Carts Turret was built
            in 122AD for the originally planned 3 metre width broad wall, before
            the decision was made to build with a reduced width of 1.8 metres.
            The turrets and small section of wall were built first and then the
            rest of the wall afterwards. Just to the north of Black Carts Turret
            the ditch can clearly be seen where, when John Clayton first
            excavated the site in 1873, he found 3 'centurial' stones showing
            the names of soldiers who built the section of wall.

            <strong>Limestone Corner: </strong>At Limestone Corner, there is an unfinished
            section of ditch filled with abandoned stone blocks: one slab still
            show the holes chiselled by the Romans to split the rock. The stone
            here is hard basalt and it appears that the Romans found this too
            hard to work with and gave up trying to complete this part of the
            ditch. Unfortunately, we did not take any photos of Limestone
            Corner, but this{" "}

            Once we had successfully reached Brocolitia/Carrawburgh Military
            Fort we returned to the car in order to travel back to Chester's
            Roman Fort and spent the remainder of the afternoon there exploring
            fully the fort and museum, leaving the exploration of Brocolitia
            Fort for the following morning.

            , one of our favourites. In 1843, John Clayton inherited the site
            from his father, who had previously turfed over the ruins. John
            Clayton excavated many parts of the fort and created the museum to
            house and maintain the many exhibits both from the fort and other
            segments of the wall. He also developed such a fascination for
            Hadrian's Wall that he bought up many other large areas of the wall.
            By the time John died in 1890 he owned five forts – Chesters,
            Carrawburgh, Housesteads, Vindolanda and Carvoran – as well as most
            of the Wall within this 20 mile stretch.
            <br />
            <br />
            If you are visiting the Chesters site, we would strongly advise
            making sure that you leave enough time and that you also have time
            to see the John Clayton Museum and the Chester's Bridge abutment
            detour right down to the river (see our previous, Day 4 entry
            regarding the Chesters Bridge abutment detour), where a narrow
            footbridge originally carried the Wall across the River North Tyne,
            but the Romans later replaced this with an impressive stone road
            bridge. The remains of the stone abutment that joined the bridge to
            the riverbank survive, along with the foundations of the tower and a
            section of the wall.
            <br />
            <br />
            The fort was situated astride Hadrian's Wall, guarding the bridge
            over the river North Tyne and was occupied by a 500 strong cavalry
            regiment, the ala II Asturum (Second Asturian Cavalry Unit) from
            Asturia in Northern Western Spain. There are plenty of information
            boards to provide further explanation for the various areas as you
            go around the fort.

            Mithraism was what was called a mystery cult. In these cults,
            devotees met in small groups to have the mysteries of the divine
            revealed to them and to undergo complex initiation rites. These
            cults drew on many aspects of Roman ritual practice but often
            claimed eastern origins; eg. the god Mithras was thought to be a
            manifestation of the Persian god Mithra. Followers used Latin in
            their rituals, erected altars and made vows in the traditional Roman
            manner, but they also depicted the god and his attendants in
            ‘Persian’ dress. The temples of the mystery cults in the frontier
            zone tended to be smaller than those associated with other practices
            and were enclosed so that the rites of the initiates were concealed
            from non-members. The Temple of Mithras is small and secluded, being
            located under the vicus of the Fort, being built to resemble the
            cave in which Mithras was said to have killed a bull and feasted
            with the God of the Sun, Soll and today it includes replicas of
            three altars and a number of statues; the originals are located in
            the Great North Museum in Newcastle upon Tyne. Someone had dutifully
            left a few penny coins in the basin of one of the replica altars.
            The original altars and statues were colorfully painted.

            (1673-7148) removed the stones from the Fort to reuse as rubble fill
            for the construction of the Military Road (which is now the B6318),
            which he planned to try to address the difficulties he encountered
            marching his troops cross-country from Newcastle to Carlisle during
            the Jacobite rising in 1745. Wade helped plan the road but had died
            before construction began in 1751. it should not be confused with
            the Military Way built by the Romans immediately south of Hadrian's
            Wall.
            <br />
            <br />
            After exploring Brocolitia/Carrawburgh Fort and the Temple of
            Mithras, it was time to cross the Old Military Road with care and
            continue following the Hadrian's Wall Path out towards Housestead's
            Fort just over 5 miles distant.
            <br />
            <br />
            Key points and way-marks on the walk after leaving the Mithras
            Temple today were the Sewingshields Wall situated precipitously on
            the edge of Sewing Shields Crags, a high rocky outcrop which
            features Milecastle 35 and Turret 35a which are all built on the
            Whin Sill, Busy Gap and King's Wicket Gate, Turret 36, Knag Burn
            Gateway and Housesteads Roman Fort. King's Wicket gate is the name
            of the wicket gate in the line of Hadrian's Wall in Busy Gap. The
            feature is thought to be a stock enclosure associated with a
            traditional drove road running through the Wall at this point. The
            date is uncertain, but in the late Middle Ages Busy Gap was a
            notorious haunt for bandits and raiders, known as 'Busy Gap rogues',
            as the stock held in the enclosure may not always have been there
            with the owner's consent.
            <br />
            <br />
            Housesteads Fort lies at about the mid-point of Hadrian's Wall and
            housed an infantry regiment of 800, the First Cohort of Tungrians
            raised in eastern Belgium. It is the the best preserved of the 16
            forts on the Hadrian's Wall frontier and also contains the finest
            preserved latrines from Roman Britain. It was abandoned between the
            early 5th until the 16th Century, when it was taken over by the
            Border Reivers, a lawless community on the Anglo-Scottish border.

                 This is without
                  exception the most awesome and stunning section of the
                  Hadrian's Wall Path, as you walk along a series of ridges of
                  the Whin Sill along which this section of the wall was built.
                  Together with the wildness and remoteness of the landscape,
                  which remains to this day largely uninhabited, this is a
                  really impressive walk and has been our favourite day's
                  walking on the Wall so far.

                   We had walked the section of the Wall between Cawfield Quarry
                  and Peel Gap in 2014 as part of a 6 3/4 mile circular walk and
                  it had been quite a lot more strenuous than we had
                  anticipated, not least because conditions underfoot were not
                  great. However, the National Trust seem to have undertaken a
                  lot of work improving the footpath to reduce erosion and this
                  was certainly an improvement underfoot compared to previously.

                which stood in Sycamore Gap, a dramatic dip in the landscape of
                Hadrian's Wall, was maliciously felled. The tree had been
                described as one of the most photographed trees in the country
                and an emblem for the North East of England. It derived its
                alternative name from featuring in a prominent scene in the 1991

               We were
                very fortunate and the good weather held out until just after we
                had returned to the car and safely settled ourselves in the café
                at the Sill Visitors Centre. At that point, the heavens opened
                and it was raining so hard, blowing in sheets, that even
                hardened walkers with full rain-proof gear were not venturing
                across the car park. For anyone who has not experienced weather
                in this area, this can come as somewhat of a shock! Our advice
                would be always come prepared and be willing to change route to
                a safer option from that planned if necessary (there are a
                number of 'escape' routes off the Wall) . Do not rely too

             It was an 8.20am start this morning, as the weather forecast for the
            afternoon was poor, so we were already at Housesteads car park in
            the sunshine and peace and quiet by 8.40am. First of all, we had to
            climb back up to the point on Hadrian's Wall at which we had
            finished yesterday's walk, namely Knag Burn gate. Whilst the fort
            itself, which is owned by the National Trust, does not open until
            10am, there is a public footpath which runs up around the edge of
            the fort which can be accessed at anytime. Once on the path, we
            headed off in a westerly direction towards Cawfield Quarry Car Park.
            <br />
            <br />
            Todays walk was to include Hotbank Crags, Crag Lough and Highshield
            Crags, Sycamore Gap, Peel Crags, Steel Rigg, Shield on the Wall,
            Whinshield Crags, Caw Gap and Cawfield Quarry. It was to be a

            Todays walk was to start in Cawfields car park and end in Gilsland
            village taking in Aesica (Great Chesters) Roman Fort, past the sites
            of Turrets 43a and 43b where no visible remains exist, Walltown
            Crags including Turrets 44b(Mucklebank) and 45a and the site of the

            Aesica Fort, whose modern name is Great Chesters (not to be confused
            with Chesters Fort at Chollerford) was the ninth fort on Hadrian's
            Wall. It lies 6.0 miles to the east of Housesteads (Roman name
            Vercovicium) and 6.5 miles to the west of Birdoswald Fort (Roman
            name Banna). Its main purpose was to guard the Caw Gap where the
            Haltwhistle Burn crosses the Wall. It was built relatively late
            (AD128), over the site of the existing Milecastle 43. There are no
            visible remains of Milecastle 43's two accompanying turrets: turret
            43A and turret 43B either. At 3 acres Aesica Fort was smaller than
            some of the other forts. More information about Aesica fort can be

            Walltown Crags: There are a number of routes over Walltown Crags and
            any can be used, but the top route offers the most spectacular views
            and is well worth the climb, so this was the route we used. It is
            also the route we suggest to others to use if walking this route (as
            long as you are up for the climb). We passed the previous site of
            Milecastle 45 which is located on the top of Walltown Crags. The
            walls have been robbed, so little remains. We understand however
            that the site is still{" "}

            . As we walked along the crags, we saw 2 Kestrels circling overhead
            which appeared to be nesting in the walls of the crag.
            <br />
            <br />
            Turret 44b (Mucklebank) has magnificent views over the surrounding
            landscape. It is unusual in that it is built into a corner of
            Hadrian's Wall. Dropping down below Turret 44b(Mucklebank) is the
            alleged site of King Arthur's Well , although there is no sign of it
            today. Turret 45a is built high on Walltown Crags. It is thought
            that the wall and turret were built separately as, whilst the Wall's
            foundations run through the turret, above ground the wall and turret
            are separate structures and there are no wing walls and the wall
            meets the turret at an angle.This suggests they were probably built
            separately.

            <br />
            Finally we dropped down to the Walltown Quarry car park where there
            is a very pleasant small Visitors Centre, where you can buy some hot
            drinks from a machine and there are picnic tables to sit on by the
            quarry. We took the opportunity to have some lunch here. There are
            also a number of walks you can do from this site, for which there
            are information boards. It is one of the pick up points for the

            by Northumberland National Park. It was then time to cross the

            towards Gilsland where we would end the walk.

                had anticipated. There are still some significant sections of

            built at this site but the earliest one was probably built under
            Hadrian at the same time as Hadrians Wall. On the North side of the
            abutment, there are two sluices with an open channel beside them:
            the channel was possibly a mill race with the sluices helping to
            control the flow of water through it. In 1999 a new millennium
            bridge over the River Irthing was designed by the architectural firm
            Napper and constructed and lowered into place using a RAF

            : The Romans occupied Birdoswald Fort for 300 years from the 2nd to
            the 5th centuries and Birdoswald's defences are the best preserved
            of any of the forts on the line of the wall. Birdoswald is
            interesting also because it was occupied after the Romans had left;
            in the Dark Ages and then again in medieval times going on to be a
            fortified farm subject to raids by the Border Reivers. It also
            contains the only drill and exercise hall ever to have been found in
            a Roman auxiliary fort.

            of Birdoswald Fort. Turret 49b is situated to the west of the River
            Irthing. Hadrian's Wall was originally built as a turf wall, but
            later it was replaced by a stone wall which followed a different
            course for 2 Roman miles between milecastle 49 and 51. Turret 49b
            was built on the line of, and around the same time as, the stone
            wall and was fully bonded with it.

            able to signal to the nearby forts at Nether Denton and Castle Hill.
            The tower was built under Trajan, long before Hadrian's Wall. The
            wall was built with a deliberate kink to incorporate the tower.

                straightforward. In areas where it can become very muddy and
                boggy in wet weather, there are stones or matting which have
                been inserted. We would advise people to use the Acorn signs,
                Hadrian's Wall Path signposts and the Carlisle OS map number 315
                to navigate and <em>not</em> Google maps, otherwise you will end

              Walton village and St Mary's church{" "} are on the path of Hadrian's Wall. 
            Walton is only a small village but is very pretty with some great views out towards Cold Fell and
            the North Pennines and has one very important feature for all walkers on the Hadrian's Wall path, the Walton Tearoom.
            Sadly Walton's tearoom is no longer open, but hurrah, there is another alternative in Walton which is

            Roman name was <em>Itouna</em> derived from the Celtic word
            <em> ituna </em> , meaning water or rushing. The river supports
            Atlantic salmon and Eurasian otter. It is, together with its

           There is
            not much in the way of wall or excavated remains now but Carlisle
            was the site of an important Roman fortress, Luguvalium, for many
            years. The fort was established by Quintus Petillius Cerialis in
            about AD 72, as the Romans took their invasion North from Chester
            and York. It was an extremely good strategic location as it guarded
            the crossing over the river Eden and provided important support to
            Agricola's invasion over the years AD 78 -84 into Scotland. The fort
            today lies largely below the Castle Keep and the present day castle
            is partly constructed from Roman stone. The vicus (the supporting
            settlement) lay to the East of the fort. There is also an impressive
            collection of local Roman remains at the Tullie House museum.

             This is the only church which stands on the line of Hadrian's wall.
            It was built in the 12th century on the site of Turret 70a and was
            constructed from sandstone , partly using stones from Hadrian's
            Wall. Little remains of the original structure as the church was
            restored on a number of occasions, most recently in the late 19th
            century. The roof dates from the 16th century.

           Michael's church in Burgh-by-Sands was built in the 12th century
            with Roman stones. There is the head of a pagan god which can be
            seen in the eastern wall. The church is more famous as the place
            where King Edward I was laid out after he died of dysentery. A
            statue of Edward I can be seen in the centre of the village and
            there is a monument to King Edward I at the site of his death a
            short distance away on Burgh Marsh.
