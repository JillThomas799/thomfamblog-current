              Bernard was born in Billinge and grew up in Ashton-in-Makerfield,
              the second eldest of three boys. He attended Ashton Grammar School
              and at 16 years of age then went onto study for his A levels at
              Wigan Technical College. After applying for and accepting a place
              to study dentistry, he changed his mind and secured a place at
              Manchester University to study medicine.
