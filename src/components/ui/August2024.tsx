          The kitchen tiling project reaches its conclusion...
        </section>
        <br />
        <div className="news">
          <section className="newsAugust">
            For the past week we have been having the kitchen, associated
            utility and ensuite bathroom tiled. This was to have been one of
            next year's projects, but in order to ensure the desired tiles
            remained available, it has been necessary to expedite it...
            <br />
            <br />
            The kitchen floor and wall tiles have been those which were in the
            property when we purchased it and comprised quarry floor tiles and
            black wall tiles. Whilst hard wearing and rustic, they have tended
            to make the room quite dark and 'closed in' and it has long been a
            plan to change these at some point.
            <br />
            <br />
            Needless to say, this has created a degree of upheaval as a number
            of the main, heavy kitchen items have had to be moved, including 2
            fridges and the microwave and meals have had to be pre-prepared as
            we were not able to walk on the kitchen floor at first to use the
            cooker.
            <br />
            <br />
            Today thankfully the tilers were completing the finishing touches
            and it is looking much better, so it has all been worth the effort.
            Here are some of the before and after photos...

            Earlier in the late Spring/ early Summer, Bernard helped Elena
            create some raised beds for her garden . Elena took a number of the
            excess bedding plants we had grown and planted them to try and
            introduce some colourful flower borders throughout the Summer
            months.

            Needless to say, it has not been the best nor warmest of summers so
            far, so they have been quite slow to grow and flower. However, they
            are looking better now after some slightly warmer days and they are
            starting to brighten the garden up. Here are some of the photos...

              <br />
              <br /> Up until AD 75 the invading Roman army had not been able to
              conquer the area which is now known as Wales due to fierce
              resistance from the native Silures tribe. In AD75 however, a new
              governor of Britain, by the name of Frontinus, decided on a new
              strategy to build a fortress at modern-day Caerleon, inside the
              territory of the Silures tribe and this fortress was to be known
              as Isca and became one of only 3 long-term forts ever built in
              Britain (the other 2 being at York and Chester).
              <br />
              <br />
              Isca was a garrison measuring 20 hectares for 5,500 men who served
              in the second Augustan Legion (Legio II Augusta). Work commenced
              on the main fortress, built in turf, soil and timber, in AD75.
              This was followed by the fortress baths in stone. The baths lasted
              longer than the Roman period and in fact lasted into medieval
              times, when the stone was used to build modern-day Carleon. Over
              time the fortress itself was converted into stone.
              <br />
              <br />
              By AD90, the threat from the Silures had gone, and a stone
              amphitheatre could be built outside the city walls, the remains of
              which can be seen today. Citizen soldiers of the Legions expected
              to be provided with the amenities of Rome, so in the amphitheatre,
              which could hold 6000 spectators on wooden, tiered seating,
              gladitorial games could be held and in the baths exercise could be
              undertaken in the swimming pool or the basilica, the large
              gym-like exercise hall.
              <br /> <br />
              Both the National Roman Legion Museum and the Amphitheatre are
              free to enter, but there is a small charge for entry to the Roman
              Baths. We felt that it was well worth paying the charge for the
              Roman Baths though as they are really well done with lighting,
              film effects and sound all helping recreate the experience of the
              Romans swimming in the pool.
              <br /> <br />

              It is situated only a short drive from the city of Newport, the
              RSPB Newport Wetlands is part of the Gwent Levels and consists of
              a diverse range of habitats including wet grassland, reedbeds,
              saltmarsh and saline lagoons. There is a seven kilometre network
              of re-surfaced paths around the Uskmouth reedbeds, viewing screens
              across the deepwater channels, and a raised viewing platform and
              bird hide. It also contains the East Usk Lighthouse which is over
              120 years old.
              <br />
              <br />
              There are a number of walking trails including the Orchid Trail (1
              mile) for looking out for orchids in late spring and early summer,
              Sculpture Trail (1 mile) which involves going through reedbridges,
              over a floating bridge and past the East Usk lighthouse, Woodland
              and Estuary Trail (1.5 miles) which involves going through
              reedbeds, woodland, past open water and the estuary, the Wetlands
              Experience (2.5 miles) which combines the orchid, the woodland and
              estuary trail and part of the Wales Coast Path and lastly the
              Green Lanes and Coast Walk (3.75 miles) which includes include the
              East Usk Lighthouse, views over the Severn Estuary as far as
              Exmoor, bird-hide, and green lanes.
              <br /> <br />
              We opted for the Wetlands Experience as we had already done a
              reasonable amount of walking around Caerleon in the morning.

              Today, Harry needed to be in Cardiff, so we combined the visit to
              Cardiff in the afternoon with a preceding visit to Penarth in the
              morning. The old haunts were visited including the Danish pastry
              shop and the café on the pier...

              Today was our last full day away on holiday before our return
              journey, so we decided to revisit the Mumbles near Swansea in the

              , near Cardiff in the afternoon. We had passed Castell Coch from
              afar many times over the past few years when traveling to and from
              Cardiff, but had never got round to visiting, so it was great to
              be able to go to see it at last. The Castle is run by CADW so
              English Heritage members can enter either for free (if repeat
              members) or half-price (if first-year members).

              Mumbles is located on Swansea Bay, and marks the start of the
              Gower Peninsula which was the UK’s first designated Area of
              Outstanding Natural Beauty. Just off Mumbles Head are 2 islands
              which can , with care and close attention to the tides, be
              accessed at low tide. However, people often get into problems when

              There is a great walk (or cycle) all along the front from the
              Mumbles Head to Swansea. This will be even better when the
              contractors have finished upgrading and refurbishing the Mumbles
              coastal sea defences. The work aims to reduce the risk of flooding
              to homes and businesses that are increasingly threatened by rising
              sea levels brought about by climate change.

              a good choice of menu. It also has pretty awesome views across the
              bay. Just a word of warning, the portion sizes are <em>huge</em>,

              Castell Coch on the other hand is situated high on the outskirts
              of Cardiff, high on a hillside. It is built on the site of a
              medieval castle which dates back to the 11th, 12th and 13th
              centuries. The basement, which you can go inside is part of the
              original medieval castle. By the early 14th century the castle
              seems to have fallen into ruin. However 550 years later, the very
              wealthy Marquess of Bute who had inherited a fortune made from the
              industrial growth of South Wales, commissioned{" "}

              to recreate a vision of the Middle Ages and build a new castle on
              the site of the old. The two already knew each other as they had
              worked together developing Cardiff Castle.
              <br />
              <br />
              Castell Coch was actually a lot more interesting and fun than we
              had anticipated. There are several forest walks up the hillside
              behind the castle which are also worthwhile and one of which we
              undertook.

                some years since we had taken the Ullswater steamer and it was a
                beautiful day for it. It cost us £10.00 each for a single ticket
                to Howtown, which is the first stop. These tickets can be
                purchase on-line in advance or from the ticket office at the
                jetty on the day.

                <strong className="titlesAugust">The challenge :</strong> This
                is a brilliant walk for a good day. It has the advantage of
                being not one of the highly popular high-level routes such as
                Helvellyn so it is not as busy. Nonetheless it is still quite a
                challenging walk, particularly the last section of steep ascent
                out of the Fusedale Valley and up on to the Roman road.

              There was nothing bad about this walk really. It was a brilliant
              day out.
              <br />
              Just one quick word of warning, a number of people who have walked
              this route when it has been misty on the summit have reported
              getting lost as there are a number of routes off the Load Pot Hill
              summit, some leading down towards Haweswater Reservoir rather than
              Ullswater and Pooley Bridge. It is for this reason best avoided in
              misty weather.
