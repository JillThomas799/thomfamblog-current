              Jill grew up near Wigan. She has from a young age had a love of
              classical music, opera and ballet and when younger learnt to play
              the piano and violin. From the age of 13 years she wanted to
              become a doctor. After obtaining the necessary A levels in
              sciences, she successfully gained a place to study medicine at
              Manchester Medical School.
