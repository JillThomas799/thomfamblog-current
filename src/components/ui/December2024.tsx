          Welcome to our December blog. This year we have developed the
          animation for the header one step further to create a snow-globe,
          which if you click on it with your mouse will raise and the globe will
          shake causing the snow to start falling, just as in real life.

          There is quite a lot going on this month as we will be away visiting
          relatives in the South and South East for some of the time, and we are
          back in London with a trip to the Victoria and Albert Museum.
          Christmas will be back home though with Elena and Harry and Lennie
          here, so we are looking forward to that. We have already made the
          Christmas puddings, just the Christmas cake left to make.

          It was time to go visiting and distributing cards and presents in time
          for Christmas, so we packed up the car and headed down South; firstly
          to Leicestershire to catch up on news with friends and then on to the
          South East of England.

          We went over to visit Bernard's father and to cook him 'Christmas'
          lunch. I know it was not Christmas day, but it was near enough. There
          was also Christmas pudding which we had made.

          We went into London on the train and met up with Bernard's brother for
          the day. We had the chance to visit the Victoria and Albert Museum,
          where we also had lunch, and the Natural History Museum in South
          Kensington, to have a walk through Hyde park and see the sights
          including the Royal Albert Hall. In the afternoon we walked as far as
          Harrods and saw how the other half live in South Kensington before
          walking in the twilight back to the tube station via Hyde Park and
          onwards to our base. We worked out by the end of the day we had walked
          10 miles in total.

          It is Christmas 2024 and Elena and Harry are here for the holiday. The
          home-made Christmas puddings and Christmas cake (with over half a
          bottle of sherry in it) are cooked and ready. The food shopping has
          been done (thanks to ELena and Jill's intrepid voyage into town food
          shopping on the 21st December 2024 - say no more! ).
          <br />
          <br />
          The tree has been erected and decorated and Lennie has been happily
          eating his way through the cat advent calendar from which Harry has
          been merrily feeding him each day. Needless to say Harry is now
          Lennie' favourite human being, so much so that Lennie starts purring
          when Harry even enters the room in a morning.....
          <br />
          <br />
          There is however one problem, Lennie does not yet realise that advent
          calendar treats only run for 24 days until the 24th December and then
          they stop for a year! There may be difficult times ahead I think.....

          This time last year there had been some feedback that Lennie was not
          achieving as much prominence on the blog as he deserved, so to make
          amends, we posted some photos of the best (and worse) of Lennie's
          activities and antics in the previous year which proved very
          popular... <br />
